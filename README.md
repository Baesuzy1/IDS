# IDS
This project is a real-time Intrusion Detection System that uses machine learning to monitor local network traffic. It captures live packets with Scapy, extracts features, and uses a trained model to detect if they're normal or malicious. If a threat is found, it raises alerts and logs the data, making network security smarter and more automated
